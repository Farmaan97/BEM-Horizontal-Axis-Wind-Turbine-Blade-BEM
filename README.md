The given BEM code is intended to analyze and present the thrust, power and the torque for the specfied turbine blade element. 
There are 2 codes attached **BEM.m** presents results for each turbine balde element consecutively while the **BEM_AUTOMATED Perfected.m** presents the integral results required for the analysis.
